# AI Super Agent Web Interface Guide

## Introduction
This guide will help you navigate and use the AI Super Agent web interface that has been set up for you.

## Access the Interface
You can access the AI Super Agent web interface at:
[https://8002-mkmwnr-eoxrvb.public.scrapybara.com](https://8002-mkmwnr-eoxrvb.public.scrapybara.com)

## Using the AI Super Agent

### Submitting a Task
1. Visit the home page of the AI Super Agent
2. In the "Submit a Task" section, enter what you'd like the AI Super Agent to do
3. Optionally, add additional details or requirements in the "Additional Details" field
4. Click "Submit Task" to begin processing

### Types of Tasks You Can Request
The AI Super Agent can perform various tasks, including:
- **Research**: Gathering information on specific topics from multiple sources
- **Analysis**: Analyzing data and extracting meaningful insights
- **Content Creation**: Generating reports, summaries, or other content

### Viewing Task Progress
After submitting a task:
1. You'll be redirected to a task details page
2. This page will show real-time progress of your task
3. You can see each step the agent takes, including:
   - Agent thoughts
   - Tool calls (like web searches)
   - Results from tools
   - Final responses

### Viewing All Tasks
You can see all your submitted tasks by clicking "View All Tasks" on the home page. This allows you to:
- See the status of all tasks (queued, in progress, completed, or failed)
- Access details for any specific task
- Start new tasks

## Technical Notes
- The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration purposes
- In a production environment, it would connect to actual LLM APIs and tools
- The interface updates automatically for tasks in progress

## Limitations
- This is a demonstration version with simulated responses
- The tasks don't perform actual web searches or API calls
- Task persistence is lost when the server restarts

## Next Steps
To deploy this in a production environment, you would need to:
1. Configure proper API keys in the .env file
2. Update the code to use actual LLM implementations instead of mocks
3. Set up persistent storage for tasks and results
4. Deploy behind proper authentication for security
